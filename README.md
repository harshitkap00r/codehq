This project consists of 2 parts: frontend and backend. To run this, we have to run both individually. In this project, I have added a backend server to get customer data from `MongoDB`.

To run the backend server:
1) Go to the backend folder.
2) Run `yarn install` to install dependencies requested by the backend.
3) Run `yarn start` to start the backend server that will run on server 5000.


To run a frontend server:
1) Go to the frontend folder.
2) Run `yarn install` to install dependencies required by the frontend.
3) Run `yarn start` to start the frontend server that will run on server 3000.
